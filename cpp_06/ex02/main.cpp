/*
** This exccercise illustrates how to identify the type of a variable.
** We are not using `std::type_info` which contains information
** about a type and usually used for that matter.
**
** The idea is to identify the type of a variable on our own.
**
** The main function tests the implementation of the different
** classes `A`, `B`, `C` and `Base` and illustrates the way 
** we can identify the type of a variable.
