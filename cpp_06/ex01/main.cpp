/*
** This exccercise is about serialization of data.
**
** The main function tests the serialization of a `Data` struct.
** First we create a `Data` struct with random values.
** Then we use `serialize` on the address of the Data object.
** Then we pass the result of `serialize` to `deserialize`
** and check if the result is the same as the original `Data` object.
