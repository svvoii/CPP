# C++

I have enjoyed the C++ modules immensely. The completed tosks successfully demonstrates the grasp of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
Intricately designed, these projects delve deep into C++ language features, emphasizing the application of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.  
Post-completion, I emerged with a strengthened ability to design, implement, and manage complex C++ applications.  

Additionally, skills acquired include the enhanced use of class structures, object management, and leveraging OOP principles to improve code efficiency and maintainability.  

- CPP00: Fundamental exploration of C++ basics, strengthening the understanding and application of syntax, data types and control structures.  
- CPP01: Deepened knowledge of memory allocation, pointers and references, exploring their utilization in C++.  
- CPP02: Introduced concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including classes and objects, encapsulation, and constructors and destructors.  
- CPP03: Further delved into OOP, focusing on inheritance and polymorphism, the cornerstone of C++ programs.  
- CPP04: Explored advanced C++ concepts, including abstract classes and interfaces, enriching my software design skills.  
- CPP05: Enhanced understanding of exception handling in C++, equipping me to build robust and fault-resistant applications.  
- CPP06: Focused on C++ Standard Template Library (STL), learning about powerful features like vectors, iterators, and algorithms.  
- CPP07: Delved into C++ templates, both function and class templates, enabling me to write more efficient and reusable code.  
- CPP08: This module focuses on the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, as well as use of standard Containers and Algorithms in C++.
- CPP09: This final module serves as a comprehensive test of all previous knowledge. It synthesizes everything learned from the basics to advanced C++ concepts, including OOP, STL, templates.
